# Contributing to Dione

Thank you for considering contributing to **Dione**! Your input whether it's code, bug reports, feature requests, or documentation, helps us build better tools and experiences.

We welcome contributions of all kinds and aim to make the process straightforward and respectful.


## 🚧 Branching Strategy

We follow a simple and consistent branching model across all repositories:

- `main`: The default branch for production-ready code. All pull requests should target this branch.
- `feature/your-feature-name`: For new features.
- `fix/your-fix-name`: For bug fixes or patches.


## 🔁 Pull Requests

Before opening a pull request:

- Ensure your code follows the repo’s formatting and linting rules.
- Run tests and type checks, if applicable.
- Write a clear title and description for the PR.
- Link to any related issues (e.g., `Closes #42`).

Pull requests will be reviewed as soon as possible. You may be asked to make changes, thank you in advance for your patience and collaboration!


## 🎨 Code Style

We use [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for formatting and linting across many of our projects. Please make sure to run the appropriate formatting commands before submitting a pull request.

If the repository uses a different tool (like ESLint, Prettier, or Black), refer to that project’s README for details.


## 🐛 Issues & Feature Requests

If you encounter a bug or want to suggest a new feature:

1. Open an issue in the appropriate repository.
2. Include a clear, concise title and description.
3. For bugs, provide steps to reproduce and environment details.
4. For features, explain the use case and potential impact.


## 📄 License
